Nina Cerniglia has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment.

Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Nina Cerniglia began her musical journey at a young age, influenced by artists like Joni Mitchell and Elliott Smith. She honed her skills at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she developed her unique style. Her debut EP, "I'll Be Waiting," garnered critical acclaim, showcasing her introspective lyrics and mesmerizing melodies.
